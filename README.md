# What are these files used for? (ELI5)
This is a collection of template files that I use when I want to quickly prototype new ideas.
They provide some basic boilerplate code for certain scenarios and should help to
quickly start prototyping eg. without worrying about window creation and input handling.

# How can I starting building prototypes using these files?

Feel free to use these project files for your prototypes.
Just copy a pair of .c and .bat files into a new directory and start typing. Just execute the .bat file and the corresponding .c file should compile automatically.

The .bat file tries to search for a valid Visual Studio installation and will use cl.exe for compilation.
